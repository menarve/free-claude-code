"""Dynamic model fallback chain for Free Claude Code.

When a requested model (default, opus/sonnet/haiku role, or a direct
``provider/model``) fails by capacity (quota / rate-limit / overload), retry
other ``provider/model`` refs discovered from the API keys that are
configured, ordered by heuristic potency (most -> least potent). This is a
best-effort, local-only behavior that only switches before the first streamed
chunk is delivered to the client.

NOTE: this module patches the editable Free Claude Code install at
``/private/tmp/free-claude-code``. Changes are lost if fcc is reinstalled or
updated; re-apply after any upgrade.
